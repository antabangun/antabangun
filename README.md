### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Antyanta Bangunharcana, a PhD candidate at the Mechatronics, Systems, and Control Lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST. My research focuses on 3D computer vision, with a particular interest in depth estimation using cameras and visual localization.

#### Projects

I have several projects, but two of my most recent ones are:

- [CoEx](https://github.com/antabangun/coex): A real-time stereo matching algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets. This work was published in IROS 2021.
- [DualRefine](https://github.com/antabangun/DualRefine): A self-supervised depth and pose estimation algorithm that uses iterative epipolar sampling and refinement to achieve high accuracy. This work will be presented at CVPR 2023.

Feel free to check out the repositories and let me know if you have any questions or comments.
